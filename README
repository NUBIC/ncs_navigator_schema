This repository includes a JSON Schema document and validation tools for
checking JSON sent between NCS Navigator Field[0] and NCS Navigator Core[1].

The validate.js program in this repo can be used to validate a JSON document 
against a schema, and should be usable in any CommonJS environment.  (However,
so far, only NodeJS has been tested.)  To use, pass the JSON document on
standard input and supply the schema to use as validate.js' first argument:

    curl https://ncs.example.edu/field_contact_set/1 \
        | node validate.js field_contact_set_schema.json
