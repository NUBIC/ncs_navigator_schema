All schemas should have

1. No trailing spaces.
2. Lexicographically ordered keys in JSON objects.

Python's json.tool module can be used to enforce #2; it's also what's used to
format the schemas.  In Python 2.6.x and 2.7.3, however, it generates trailing
spaces, so be sure to run the output through git stripspace or an equivalent
pre-commit hook.
