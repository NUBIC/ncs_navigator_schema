All schemas should have

1. No trailing spaces.  Use git stripspace or set up a pre-commit hook (using
   git stripspace) to enforce this.
2. Lexicographically ordered keys in JSON objects.

Python's json.tool module can be used to enforce #2; it's also what's used to
format the schemas.  In Python 2.6.x and 2.7.3, however, it generates trailing
spaces, so be sure to run the output through git stripspace.
